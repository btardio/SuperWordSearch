This assignment took a little under half a day. The rationale for using a 
database was that I have spent the last year working with databases and it 
seemed like a logical thing to do at the time. My rationale for using C was 
that I wanted to discover the GNU library for connecting to databases. There
is a lot to do here, there wasn't a single test written but I can't afford to
spend more than a half a day on this assignment.

On a positive note, this solution is capable of handling any size puzzle 
regardless of available ram. A second positive note is that once the puzzle
possibilities are calculated future queries are done in logn time. A third
positive note is that it can easily be multi-threaded, greatly improving
performance on a large system.

I have included a docker image of this solution due to its complexity on
different systems.

The following is required for Fedora:

dnf install gcc
dnf install intltool
dnf install itstool
dnf install glib2
dnf install libxml2
dnf install glib2-devel
dnf install libxml2-devel
dnf install openssl-devel
dnf install make
dnf install sqlite
dnf install sqlite-devel
dnf install libgee
dnf install libgee-devel

wget https://ftp.gnome.org/pub/GNOME/sources/libgda/5.2/libgda-5.2.8.tar.xz

tar -xvJf libgda-5.2.8.tar.xz

./configure --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --enable-system-sqlite --enable-binreloc
